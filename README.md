Welcome to the coolest, most vibe-coded calculator on the block! 😎 This is a simple, yet elegant, calculator built with C and the GTK3 toolkit.

## ✨ Features ✨

* Basic arithmetic operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).
* A crystal clear display 🔮.
* A trusty Clear button (C) to wipe the slate clean.
* Handles division by zero like a champ (it tells you it's an error, of course! 😜).
* A responsive and clean user interface.

## 🎶 Vibe Check ✅

This project was purely **vibe coded**™️. What does that mean? It means it was built with good music, good energy, and a whole lot of passion! 🚀

Major inspiration was drawn from this absolute banger of a YouTube video. Go check it out! 👇

## 🛠️ How to Build and Run 🛠️

Ready to crunch some numbers? First, make sure you have GTK3 installed on your system.

**1. Compile the code:**
Open your terminal and run this command. It's like a magic spell! 🪄

```bash
gcc calculator.c -o calculator $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0)
```

**2. Run the application:**

If the spell worked, you can now launch the calculator with:

```bash
./calculator
```

And that's it!!
